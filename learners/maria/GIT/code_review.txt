In a land where the coders unite,  
With their keyboards, they code day and night.  
Through Git they will share,  
With reviews they will care,  
Making software that shines oh so bright.  

# the extra line is because it was requested - 
A bug that once brought them despair,  
Is squashed with a click and a stare.  
As pull requests flow,  
Their knowledge will grow,  
In this loop of creation, what flair!  

So raise up your glasses, let's cheer,  
To the coders who conquer their fear.  
With code crafted tight,  
And reviews done just right,  
In the world of tech, they persevere!
