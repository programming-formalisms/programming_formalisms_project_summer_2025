# Pair programming questions, Milena and Xiuqi

1. What is pair programming?
    Two people working at the same computer to write code. One person writes the code and the other one reviews and observes as the code is written
2. How does a good pair behave? Describe what can be observed when pairing online
    It depends on the kind of people in the pair, a novice-expert pair would behave differently from an expert-expert pair.
    In general, both people are active and engaged and it is always encouraged to question current procedure.
3. When to switch roles? Give a procedure
    Could set a timer so that every n minutes the pair switches
4. What effects does pair programming have?
    In general, it increases man-hours, but it also decreases debugging time and considers more alternative solutions when the code is more complex.
    For more simple code, people tend to become bored and the outcomes are worse
